# Dependency management:
The code requires dash, dash.html, dash.dcc, pandas, and dask.dataframe libraries.
All this libraries can easily be installed using the python manager 'pip install package'
'pip install dash pandas datapackage dask'
A load_prices_dask function is defined to load two energy price datasets from DataHub as a Pandas dataframe and perform data cleaning operations on them (e.g., removing missing values).
The oil_df and gas_df dataframes are created using the load_prices_dask function.
A dash app is initialized with a layout defined in HTML. The layout consists of:
A dropdown menu to select between oil and natural gas prices
A submit button to trigger the update of the price graphs and histograms
Four graphs to display the line graph of energy prices, histogram of prices, boxplot of prices, and scatterplot of prices over time.
Callback functions are defined to update the graphs and histograms whenever the submit button is clicked.
The code also defines an update_n_clicks function to increment the number of clicks on the submit button.
